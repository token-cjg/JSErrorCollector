JSErrorCollector
---------------
## Now not just errors! ##


This project allows to capture JavaScript ~~errors~~ logs while running tests with [WebDriver] (currently only in Java).
Ideally this feature should be built-in [WebDriver] but it is not (yet?) the case (see WebDriver issue [API for checking for JavaScript errors on the page] [1] for details).
Other information concerning JavaScript error capturing with WebDriver is available in this [blog post] [3].

## Building ##

```java
cd firefox
bash build.sh
```

## Features ##

 - provide access to JavaScript errors while running tests with a FirefoxDriver (in Java)

## Usage in Java ##
```java
FirefoxProfile ffProfile = new FirefoxProfile();
JavaScriptError.addExtension(ffProfile);
final WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(ffProfile);

driver.get("http://somesite");
		
final List<JavaScriptError> jsErrors = JavaScriptError.readErrors(driver);
assertTrue("JS errors occured: " + jsErrors, jsErrors.isEmpty());
```
## Download ##

Pre-built jar file is available in [dist folder] [2].

## For non Java users ##

The Firefox extension (the [.xpi file] [5]) can be used from any language having a WebDriver binding.
Here are a few examples:
- [in Ruby from Cucumber + Capybara] [4].
- [in Ruby with Watir] [8].

A **.NET port is available**: [JSErrorCollector.NET by protectedtrust] [7].
